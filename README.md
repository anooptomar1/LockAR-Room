# LockAR Room

Try on, share, and purchase iconic FC Bayern jerseys using ARKit for iPhone X. (#FCBayernHackDays)

## Challenge description

Develop innovative and fascinating AR/VR/MR features & use cases for the FC Bayern community & Deutsche Telekom, with regards to satisfying fan needs with wow-effects, increasing the fan experience via value added services and enriching the fan journey with new experiences and information.

## Problem/task

Jerseys are powerful. They symbolize loyalty, identity and pride. It's a pure expression of fandom. We believe there is a huge potential to evolve the jersey experience for the fans by making it more digital and thereby creating emotion and individual content. We make every jersey available everywhere.

## Solution

With our solution, we are directly tackling the availability and experience of team jerseys. Our prototype is able to put a fan in every current or former jersey of his club with the help of AR. He or she opens a photo app on the smartphone and can swipe through the available jerseys. The app allows you to take pictures and share them with your friends on various channels. It also covers an option to go to the online fan shop to buy the real jersey. We make every jersey available everywhere.
